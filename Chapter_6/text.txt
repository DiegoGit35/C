Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
Im crying, Im crying
Im crying, Im crying
Yellow matter custard
Dripping from a dead dogs eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, youve been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the egg man
They are the egg men
I am the walrus
Goo goo gjoob
